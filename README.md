This project was carried out by using a dataset obtained
from a survey of professionals in the data field.
The objective of the project was to gather enough insight to
serve as a guideline for both for aspiring and incumbent data professionals for
understanding the industry and what it takes to break into a chosen field.


In this project, I showcased my skills in some areas in data analysis such as
 PowerBI, Power Query, DAX, Excel, data reporting, analytical thinking, organization,
 communication, and presentation skills.
